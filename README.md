A command line program written in ruby to sort multiple blocks, from a single .gpr file, in to individual or associated blocks in to separate files.

Some time single block is associated with single sample testing and its programatically difficult to analyze different blocks data available in single gpr file and thats why sorting is important for further analysis of microarray data.

Just clone the repository and execute 'ruby init.rb'. Just follow the commands and sort your blocks of data.
